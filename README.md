# AdofaiCSL

Custom Song Loader for non-workshop levels

## Instructions

1. Open adofai once with the mod installed, this will create a folder called `CustomSongs` in the adofai base directory.
2. Add your songs to the `CustomSongs` directory, the 2 allowed path are:
    - `~\A Dance Of Fire And Ice\CustomSongs\<SONG_NAME>\main.adofai`
    - `~\A Dance Of Fire And Ice\CustomSongs\<CATERGORY_NAME>\<SONG_NAME>\main.adofai`
3. Go into the mod options by pressing `ctrl+f10` and click the icon with the 3 sliders next to the mod named `AdofaiCSL`.
4. Click the `refresh` button, this will always be at the end of the list.
5. If you installed the songs correctly they should show up as buttons, if not check if your paths match the 2 paths shown in step 2!
6. To play as song, simply click on the corresponding button.
7. Does stuff not load in? Go to the pause menu and click `Level Editor`, this should load in everything that was missing before.
